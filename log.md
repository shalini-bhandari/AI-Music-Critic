1: Initial Model used : Single Decision tree
accuracy : 36.17%
Likely learned trianing data a bit too specifically - Ovefitting - and struggled to apply those rules to new test data

2: using Random forest  - ensemble model that builds many decision tress and then takes majority vote on the prediction
 - we will perform feature scaling
 - use standard scalar
 - n_estimators means number of trees
 - accuracy: 51.69%
